This repo contains the latest WoW UI source code.  Branches should reflect the most recent patches to their respective clients (live, PTR and beta).  Patchnotes are also included, so you can view diffs for them if you're curious how they changed over time before release.

Fork of [Gethe's repo](https://github.com/Gethe/wow-ui-source), but it wasn't updated quickly enough for me to check out the latest changes (sorry).
